# Motor CLI Example

This example demonstrates how to control a motor using the `XDuinoRails_MotorDriver` library with a simple command-line interface.

## Commands

- `s <speed>`: Set the target speed in pulses per second (PPS).
- `d <0|1>`: Set the direction (0 for reverse, 1 for forward).
- `a <rate>`: Set the acceleration in PPS/s.
- `c <rate>`: Set the deceleration in PPS/s.
- `k <pwm> <ms>`: Set the startup kick PWM and duration.
